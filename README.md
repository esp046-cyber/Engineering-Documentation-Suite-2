Here's what I've built:
🏗️ Engineering Documentation Suite 2026
Key Features:
📱 Mobile-Optimized Interface

1% margins throughout
Small, compact fonts (10-16px)
Touch-friendly cards and buttons
Swipe gestures for modal closing
Responsive grid layouts

📚 24 Engineering Modules Covering:

Technical Documentation - Datasheets, I/O Lists, Loop Diagrams, P&IDs
Study & Design - FEED, Design Basis, Philosophy Documents, SOW
Safety & Risk - HAZOP, SIL/SIS Documentation
Procurement - RFQ, TBE, Vendor Reviews, Cost Estimates, MTO
Execution - Construction Packages, Bid Documents, Procedures
Calculations - Valve sizing, flow elements, transmitter ranging

✨ Professional Features:

Category filtering (All, Technical, Study, Procurement, Safety, Execution)
Real-time search across all modules
Quick action buttons for common tasks
Statistics dashboard (24 modules, 156 templates, 42 procedures)
Color-coded badges by module type
Bottom navigation bar for easy access

🧮 Interactive Tools:

Control valve Cv calculations (IEC 60534)
Step-by-step calculation results
Form-based data entry for all modules
Export capabilities

Added updateCalcForm() function - No more "undefined" error
Implemented all 5 calculation types with complete formulas and outputs:
